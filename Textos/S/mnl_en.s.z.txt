You gotta figure,
everything starts someplace.

The closest thing for me
is when I was just seven days old,
and I met her.
!******************************!
After seven days
of clinging to a number and a name,
I had trouble processing anything else.

I couldn't have told you
who the people in black coats were,
or what they wanted with me.
!******************************!
That was my first day working for the Organization.
They gave me missions, and I carried them out.
But if you asked me what my job was...
I would've just stared at you.
!******************************!
And that was how I found out
the Organization's goal.
So they wanted to collect these things
called “hearts.”

I didn't know what a heart was,
or how it even mattered.
But at least I knew what my part was.
!******************************!
I found out I was a Nobody―
that I was incomplete.
Just like the rest of them,
I came into the world without a heart.

Would it have made a difference?
If I had a heart...
would that make me somebody?
!******************************!
They taught me that my Keyblade releases hearts.
But why do I have it?
How did I learn to use it?

The more I learned,
the less I seemed to know.
!******************************!
Later on, I discovered the job
was more than just a commute
between the castle and that town.

The walls between worlds are steep,
so we create our own ways: dark corridors
which lead to every place imaginable.
!******************************!
Our group had its good apples,
just like it had its bad.
But everybody wanted the same thing:
to complete Kingdom Hearts.

What is Kingdom Hearts?
What happens when we gather enough hearts
and finish it?

I didn't know then...still don't...
But I'll fight for my chance to be someone whole―
fight against the darkness,
for however long it takes.
!******************************!
